		<p>The World Cup is the biggest sport's tournament in the world where the best 32 national soccer teams fight for the cup. The World Cup is held every four-years since its inaugural tournament in 1930. The most successful team is Brazil with 5 titles, and Italy and Germany are close behind with 4 titles each. In my league, the world cup takes place every four years starting in 1930 just like the original world cup. The best team in my league is Mexico with 3 tiles while the rest of the winners-Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, and Honduras- have one title each.</p>
