	<article align="left">
	<p>This was my first Euro cup, and I chose the host, Hungary, at random. In this tournament, 12 teams participated including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Russia, England, Croatia, Austria, Switzerland, and Greece. The tournament had a round-robin and knock-out format in which the teams were split into 3 groups of four. The top 8 teams with the highest point advanced to the knock-out stages to determine the tournaments champion. It was a tough battle for everyone, but at the end France and Spain fought for the cup in which France came victorios and won the first Euro Cup.</p>
